# PokeDex-App
catalog of Pokemons (created using Pok√©API V2 by Paul Hallett and Zane Adickes) 

NOTE !!! 
In this task I was asked to get familiar with documentation of the API I would be using.
As this is a free API the creators were asking to locally cache resources whenever we request them.
In order to minimize the amount of request to their API I have decided to store the data I have already fetched
to localStorage. With every Pokemon we want to display app is checking for if this Pokemon already exists in your localStorage.
If so, the Pokemon data will be taken from localStorage instead of sending another request.
By using this app you agree to save data in your localStorage. 
If you are done with using this app please consider clicking on "clear localStorage" button.
